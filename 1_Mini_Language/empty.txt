Language Specification:

 1 .Language Definition:

  1.1 Alphabet:

  1.1.a. Upper (A-Z) and lower case letters (a-z) of the English alphabet

      b. Underline character '_';

      c. Decimal digits (0-9);

 2. Lexic:
    a. Operators : +,-,*,/, =,>=,<=,<,>,!=
    b. Separators : ;,:,{},[]
    c. Reserved Words : var, int, bool, IF, ELSE, WHILE, read, write, begin, end, program
    d. Identifiers : sequence of letters (a-z) and digits (0-9), where the first character must be a letter.
                identifier ::= letter {letter | digit}
                letter ::= "a" | "b" | "c" | ... | "z"
                digit ::= "0" | "1" | ... | "9"
    e. Constants : non-negative integer and boolean
                number_const ::= digit {digit}
                bool_const ::= "true" | "false"

 3. Sintax
    program ::="program" identifier declist stmtlist "end"
              -declist is a list of variable declarations
              -smtmtlist is a seq of statements
#variable declaration
    declist ::= declaration | declaration ";" declist
    declaration ::= "var" identifier ":" type
    type ::="int" |"bool"
#statements
    stmtlist ::= stmt | stmt ";" stmtlist
    stmt ::= assignment | iostmt | ifstmt | whilestmt
